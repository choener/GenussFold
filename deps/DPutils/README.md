# DPutils

Small set of utility functions. Currently centered around dynamic programming.

*Math.TriangularNumbers* provides indexing into upper triangular tables. With
back and forth between the index pair and the linear index.

*Data.Paired.Vector* provided rectangular and upper-triangular pairing of
elements from a vector.

*Data.Paired.Foldable* is a more powerful generalization of such pairing for
any foldable container. We try to only retain elements that will be needed for
the pairing, while others are being filtered out.

*Pipes.Parallel* provides some simple tools for parallelisation of tasks with
the pipes eco-system.
