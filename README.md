# OrderedBits

The OrderedBits library provides methods to generate unboxed vectors of Ints
(and others) ordered by their population count or Hamming distance to the 0
set. In other words, we enumerate the power set of a given input set.

Such an order is important for dynamic programming algorithms for Hamiltonian
path problems and the travelling salesman problem.
